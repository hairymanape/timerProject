# timer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I don't know what im doing. :(

## Stuff I need to figure out:

Converting to a duration instead of elapsed milliseconds custom timer.
This will require:

1. Tap on card to set to active
2. take a datetime value based off of time
3. when no longer active take another datetime value
4. pass this through duration class to determine time elapsed
5. add this to the project code key in json file.

Is this worth it? I dont know.
